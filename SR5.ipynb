    "Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the dataset.\n",
    "In each iteration, binary search divides the search space in half by comparing the target element with the middle element of the dataset.\n",
    "As a result, the search space reduces exponentially with each iteration, leading to a logarithmic time complexity.\n",
    "This efficiency allows binary search to quickly locate the target element, especially in large datasets.\n",

    "Binary search has a space complexity of O(1), indicating constant space usage.\n",
    "The algorithm only requires a few variables to store indices and perform comparisons, regardless of the size of the dataset.\n",
    "It does not require any additional data structures or memory allocation, making it efficient in terms of space usage.\n",

    "The O(log n) time complexity of binary search signifies its efficiency, particularly for large datasets.\n",
    "The logarithmic growth rate means that the time taken to search for an element increases slowly even as the dataset size grows exponentially.\n"
